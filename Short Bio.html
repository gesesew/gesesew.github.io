      <h1>Short Bio</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Gesesew Reta. I grew up in a small village called Toll, located about 250 km north of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in a farming family whose livelihood depended entirely on agriculture. Like my family, I also worked on the farm until I completed the nearby elementary school (up to grade 8). I then moved to the small town of Molale to pursue my secondary education. After successfully completing high school, I joined Debre Berhan University for my bachelor’s degree and became part of the Department of Physics—although my first preference had actually been mathematics. Despite that, I graduated with distinction, ranking third in my class. At that time, I never imagined becoming an astronomer; I simply hoped to teach physics in high school. However, I was later given the opportunity to continue my studies, earning a Master’s degree from Dilla University and a second Master’s from the University of Ghana. Eventually, I traveled to India to pursue my Ph.D. in Astronomy, which I successfully completed in 2025 after overcoming numerous challenges, including delays caused by the global pandemic.
