      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Gesesew Reta. I grew up in a small village called Toll, located about 250 km north of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in a farming family whose livelihood depended entirely on agriculture. Like my family, I also worked on the farm until I completed the nearby elementary school (up to grade 8). I then moved to the small town of Molale to pursue my secondary education. After completing high school, I joined Debre Berhan University for my bachelor’s degree and became part of the Department of Physics—although my first preference had been mathematics. I graduated with distinction, ranking third in my class. I later earned two Master’s degrees (from Dilla University and the University of Ghana) and completed my Ph.D. in Astronomy in India in 2025, overcoming various challenges including delays caused by the global pandemic.
